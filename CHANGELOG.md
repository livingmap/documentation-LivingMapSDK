# LivingMapSDK Documentation Changelog

Due to the nature that versions (branches) of this documentation are tied to 
their respective versions of the software it is documenting, it may be that documentation 
updates may happen to older versions of the documents. Therefore, updates to the 
documentation should include the date, and the versions the change will impact. 

Each version should group and class changes in the following format:

- `Added` for new features.
- `Changed` for changes in existing functionality.
- `Deprecated` for soon-to-be removed features.
- `Removed` for now removed features.
- `Fixed` for any bug fixes.
- `Security` in case of vulnerabilities.
