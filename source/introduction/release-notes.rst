SDKs and Accelerators
---------------------

The *Living Map Framework* is divided into Core SDKs, and supporting 'Accelerator' SDK Packages.

Each Core SDK will be versioned independently and compatibility between these versions will be noted here. Accelerator SDK Packages will likewise be versioned independently, however their integration into a project will automatically include necessary compatible versions of Core SDKs.

The latest versions of Core SDKs and Accelerator SDK Packages are:

Versioning Scheme
-----------------

The *Living Map Framework* packages follow `Semantic Versioning <https://semver.org/>`_. Major/Minor SDK releases are released on a roughly quarterly basis, whereas Patch releases may be released more frequently. Minor and Patch releases should never contain breaking changes. Guides on how to upgrade from previous versions to new versions will be provided in the :doc:`../introduction/upgrade-guide` section.


Support Policy
--------------

For LTS releases, such as LivingMapSDK 1.1, bug fixes are provided for 2 years and security fixes are provided for 3 years. These releases provide the longest window of support and maintenance. For general releases, bug fixes are provided for 6 months and security fixes are provided for 1 year.
