Versioning Scheme
-----------------

The *LivingMapSDK* follows `Semantic Versioning <https://semver.org/>`_. Major/Minor SDK releases are released on a roughly quarterly basis, whereas Patch releases may be released more frequently. Minor and Patch releases should never contain breaking changes. Guides on how to upgrade from previous versions to new versions will be provided in the :doc:`../introduction/upgrade-guide` section.

Note that due to a number of initial internal releases, the first *public* version of the SDK begins from v10.0.


Support Policy
--------------

For general releases, bug fixes are provided for 6 months and security fixes are provided for 1 year.
