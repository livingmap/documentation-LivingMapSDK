LivingMapSDK Documentation
==========================

Living Map provides mapping and routing solutions for complex spaces in the form of software development kits (SDKs). This documentation details how to integrate and use the *LivingMapSDK* which provides an indoor positioning and route finding system for Android and iOS applications.

The *LivingMapSDK* can be used as either a standalone location object by means of a listener interface, or as a web-based map fragment which can be displayed directly within an application.
